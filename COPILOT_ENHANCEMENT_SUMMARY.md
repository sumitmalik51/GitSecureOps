/**
 * Enhanced Copilot Access Management
 * 
 * This enhancement adds automatic organization invitation when assigning Copilot access.
 * The feature mirrors GitHub's behavior where users can be invited and granted access in one flow.
 * 
 * Key Enhancements:
 * 
 * 1. GitHubService.checkOrganizationMembership()
 *    - Checks if a user is already a member of the organization
 *    - Returns true if user is a public member, false otherwise
 * 
 * 2. GitHubService.inviteUserToOrganization()
 *    - Invites a user to an organization with specified role (member/admin)
 *    - Returns success status, message, and invitation URL
 * 
 * 3. GitHubService.addCopilotUsersWithInvite()
 *    - Enhanced method that combines membership checking, invitation, and Copilot assignment
 *    - Automatically invites non-members before adding them to Copilot
 *    - Provides detailed results for each user processed
 * 
 * 4. CopilotManager UI Updates:
 *    - Updated help text to reflect automatic invitation capability
 *    - Enhanced success message display with detailed status per user
 *    - Better error handling and user feedback
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Streamlines the process of adding users to Copilot
 * - Eliminates the need to manually invite users before assigning Copilot access
 * - Provides clear feedback about invitation and assignment status
 * - Maintains the same user experience as GitHub's native interface

// Example of the enhanced workflow:
/*
1. User enters usernames: ['existing-member', 'new-user']
2. System checks membership:
   - 'existing-member': already in org
   - 'new-user': not in org
3. System invites 'new-user' to organization
4. System adds both users to Copilot
5. User receives detailed feedback:
   - "Successfully processed 2 user(s) (1 invited to organization)"
   - "• 1 user(s) were invited to the organization and added to Copilot"
   - "• 1 existing member(s) were added to Copilot"
