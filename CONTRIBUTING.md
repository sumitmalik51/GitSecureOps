# Contributing to GitSecureOps ü§ù

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitSecureOps! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and GitHub API

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GitHub-AccessOps.git
   cd GitHub-AccessOps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Formatting**: Consistent with ESLint configuration
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, camelCase names for variables and functions

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Example component structure
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface ComponentProps {
  prop1: string;
  prop2?: number;
}

export default function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### API Integration
- Use the existing `githubService.ts` for GitHub API calls
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Implement proper loading states
- Add appropriate error boundaries

### Styling Guidelines
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility-first approach
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes
- **Animations**: Subtle, purposeful animations

## üîß Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Create an issue if one doesn't exist
3. Get approval for significant changes
4. Ensure your local main branch is up to date

### Making Changes
1. **Write Clean Code**
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Add proper TypeScript types
   - Include error handling
   - Write meaningful comments

2. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # Check code style
   npm run build         # Test production build
   npm run preview       # Test production preview
   ```

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Test with different permission levels
   - Validate all user inputs

### Commit Guidelines
Use conventional commit format:
```
feat: add new 2FA compliance feature
fix: resolve token validation issue
docs: update README with new features
style: improve button hover animations
refactor: optimize GitHub API service
test: add unit tests for helpers
```
