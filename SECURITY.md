# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

GitSecureOps takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and security guidelines for users.

## üîê Security Features

### **Zero Data Storage**
- GitHub tokens are **never stored** on any server
- All operations are performed **client-side only**
- Tokens remain in browser memory during session only
- **No data persistence** - everything is cleared on logout

### **Token Security**
- **Comprehensive validation** of GitHub token formats
- Support for multiple GitHub token types (PAT, fine-grained, OAuth)
- **Secure token handling** with immediate cleanup
- **No token transmission** to third-party services

### **API Security**
- **Direct GitHub API integration** - no proxy servers
- **HTTPS-only communications** with GitHub
- **Minimal required permissions** principle
- **Rate limiting awareness** and handling

### **Client-Side Security**
- **Content Security Policy** headers
- **XSS protection** through React's built-in sanitization
- **CSRF protection** through GitHub's API design
- **Input validation** for all user inputs

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **How to Report**
If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email directly** to: sumitmalik51@gmail.com
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Provide** steps to reproduce if possible
5. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure

### **What to Include**
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** if you have one
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### **Response Timeline**
- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## üîí Security Best Practices for Users

### **Token Management**
1. **Use minimal permissions** required for your use case
2. **Regularly rotate** your GitHub tokens
3. **Never share** tokens with others
4. **Use fine-grained tokens** when possible
5. **Revoke unused tokens** immediately

### **Required GitHub Token Permissions**

#### **For Basic Repository Management:**
- `repo` - Full control of private repositories
- `read:org` - Read organization membership

#### **For Organization Management:**
- `admin:org` - Full control of organizations and teams
- `read:user` - Read user profile information

#### **For 2FA Compliance Checking:**
- `read:org` - Read organization membership
- `admin:org_hook` - Read organization webhooks (if needed)

#### **For GitHub Actions Management:**
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows
- `read:packages` - Download packages from GitHub Package Registry

### **Safe Usage Guidelines**
1. **Always logout** when finished
2. **Use private/incognito browsing** for sensitive operations
3. **Verify repository names** before bulk operations
4. **Review permissions** before granting access
5. **Keep the application updated** to latest version

### **Browser Security**
- **Use updated browsers** with latest security patches
- **Enable automatic updates** for your browser
- **Consider using dedicated browser profiles** for GitHub management
- **Clear browser data** after sensitive operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### **Rate Limiting**
- GitHub API has rate limits that could affect functionality
- The application handles rate limiting gracefully
- Large operations may take time due to rate limiting

### **Browser Storage**
- Tokens are stored in browser memory only
- **No localStorage or sessionStorage** usage for sensitive data
- Application state is cleared on tab close

### **Network Security**
- All communications use HTTPS
- No data sent to third-party analytics
- GitHub API calls are direct from browser

## üîç Security Auditing

### **Regular Security Reviews**
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security patches are applied promptly
- Code reviews include security considerations

### **Automated Security Scanning**
- **npm audit** for dependency vulnerabilities
- **ESLint security rules** for code quality
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety

### **Third-Party Security**
- **No third-party services** for data processing
- **Minimal external dependencies**
- **Trusted CDNs only** (Tailwind CSS, fonts)
