- ✅ Removed wildcard CORS policies

### 6. Weak CSRF Protection
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Risk:** Cross-site request forgery attacks

**Issues Found:**
- Simple random string generation for state parameter
- No cryptographically secure random generation

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Implemented cryptographically secure random state generation using `crypto.getRandomValues`
- ✅ Added fallback with enhanced randomness for unsupported environments
- ✅ Increased state parameter entropy and length

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues (FIXED)

### 7. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Risk:** Development server attacks, supply chain vulnerabilities

**Issues Found:**
- 2 moderate severity npm vulnerabilities in esbuild/vite
- Outdated packages with known security issues

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Updated vite to v7.1.4 (SemVer major update)
- ✅ Resolved all npm audit vulnerabilities
- ✅ Updated build dependencies to secure versions

### 8. Information Disclosure
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Risk:** Internal system information leakage

**Issues Found:**
- Error messages exposing stack traces in production
- Verbose error details in API responses
- Potential for sensitive information leakage

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Implemented environment-aware error handling
- ✅ Generic error messages for production environments
- ✅ Detailed errors only in development mode
- ✅ Added timestamp and request ID to error responses

### 9. HTTP Request Security
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Risk:** SSRF attacks, memory exhaustion, request timeout issues

**Issues Found:**
- No URL validation in HTTP request functions
- Missing request timeouts
- No response size limits
- Unrestricted domain access

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Implemented strict URL validation and domain whitelisting
- ✅ Added 30-second request timeouts
- ✅ Implemented 10MB response size limits
- ✅ Restricted requests to GitHub domains only
- ✅ Added proper User-Agent headers

### 10. Rate Limiting Gaps
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ⚠️ MITIGATED  
**Risk:** API abuse, resource exhaustion

- Potential for GitHub API rate limit exhaustion

**Mitigation Applied:**
- ✅ Added configurable delay between API requests (200ms)
- ✅ Implemented request batching and pagination limits
- ✅ Added rate limit awareness in API responses
- **Note:** Full rate limiting requires additional infrastructure

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of input validation and sanitization
- Both client-side and server-side security controls
- Redundant security measures for critical operations

### 2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Minimal required permissions for API access
- Restricted domain access for HTTP requests
- Limited data exposure in error messages

### 3. **Secure by Default**
- Safe fallbacks for all security-critical functions
- Strict validation that fails securely
- Conservative timeout and limit configurations

### 4. **Zero Trust Architecture**
- All inputs validated regardless of source
- No implicit trust between components
- Explicit security checks at all boundaries

## Remaining Security Considerations

### Future Enhancements (Recommended)
1. **Implement proper JWT tokens** instead of base64 session handling
2. **Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers** to prevent XSS
3. **Implement server-side rate limiting** with Redis or similar
4. **Add audit logging** for security-relevant events
5. **Implement API key rotation** mechanisms
6. **Add security scanning** to CI/CD pipeline
7. **Implement session management** with secure storage
8. **Add multi-factor authentication** support

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **Set up security event monitoring** for failed authentication attempts
2. **Monitor API rate limit usage** to detect abuse
3. **Track error rates** to identify potential attacks
4. **Monitor for unusual access patterns**
