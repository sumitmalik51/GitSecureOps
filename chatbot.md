Here’s a clear checklist for implementing the Productivity Features you mentioned for your GitSecureOps app. You can tick items as you go:

Productivity Features Checklist
1️⃣ Repo Quick Links

 Create a user-specific storage for bookmarked repos (DB table / local storage / browser storage).

 Add UI button/icon to bookmark/unbookmark a repo.

 Display bookmarked repos in a dedicated section on the dashboard.

 Allow quick access to bookmarked repos with one click.

 Optionally: allow organizing bookmarks into folders or tags.

2️⃣ Recent Activity Feed

 Fetch recent PRs, commits, and issues from all org repos via GitHub API.

 Aggregate and sort results by timestamp (most recent first).

 Display activity in a clear, scrollable feed on the dashboard.

 Highlight important events (e.g., merged PRs, assigned issues).

 Allow filtering feed by type (PR, commit, issue).

3️⃣ Search Filters

 Implement filters for repo name, language, branch, and activity type.

 Connect filters to your search API for dynamic results.

 Make filters easy to toggle or select (dropdowns, checkboxes, tags).

 Allow combining multiple filters for advanced search.

 Ensure filtered results update in real-time without page reload.

4️⃣ Code Snippets Preview

 Fetch small sections of code (first few lines or function definitions) from search results.

 Display snippet in search results with syntax highlighting.

 Add “Expand” or “View Full File” link to open the repo/file in GitHub.

 Limit snippet size to avoid clutter (e.g., 10–20 lines).

 Ensure snippet respects private repo permissions.
