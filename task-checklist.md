# ‚úÖ GitHub Repo Access Manager ‚Äì Task List

This task list outlines the steps to build a static UI app that:
- Accepts a GitHub PAT and username
- Lists all repositories (public/private)
- Displays collaborators
- Allows removing access via checkboxes

---

## üîß Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] ~~Create input field for GitHub username~~ (Not needed - username auto-detected from PAT)
- [x] Store PAT securely in local state (do not persist)

---

## üè¢ Phase 3: GitHub Org & Repo Discovery
- [x] Call `GET /user/orgs` to list organizations
- [x] Call `GET /user/repos` to list personal and accessible repos
- [x] Call `GET /orgs/{org}/repos` for org-specific repos
- [x] Provide UI toggle for:
  - [x] Show only public repos
  - [x] Show only private repos

---

## üìã Phase 4: Repo Display & Access Selection
- [x] Display all repositories in a list/table with checkboxes

---

## üë• Phase 5: Collaborator Access Listing
- [x] Call `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators` for each repo
- [x] Aggregate and deduplicate collaborators across repos
- [x] Display unique list of users with access

---

## ‚ùå Phase 6: Remove Access Logic
- [x] On action, call `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}`
- [x] Confirm before removing access
- [x] Show status (success/failure) per operation
- [x] Handle API errors (permissions, rate limits)

---

## üß™ Phase 7: Testing and UX Enhancements
- [x] Add loading indicators for API calls
- [x] Show API error messages (e.g., invalid PAT)
- [x] Show success/failure banners/toasts
- [x] Test with real GitHub accounts and tokens

---

## üßº Phase 8: Optional Enhancements
- [x] Add dark/light mode toggle
- [x] Export list of collaborators to CSV
- [x] Persist UI settings (theme, filters)
- [x] Retry logic for rate-limited operations
- [x] Add org/repo search capability

---

## üéØ Phase 9: New Dashboard Flow (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create dashboard with options after authentication
- [x] Add "Delete User Access by Username" feature
- [x] Add "List Private Repositories" feature
- [x] Add "List Public Repositories" feature  
- [x] Add "Export All Usernames" feature with Excel export
- [x] Implement improved error handling and progress indicators
- [x] Add CSV export functionality for all features

---

## üéØ Phase 10: Performance & Scope Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- [x] Add organization selection step before each feature
- [x] Allow users to choose scope: Personal repos, specific org, or all repos
- [x] Optimize delete user access with batched API calls and progress tracking
- [x] Implement scope-based repository filtering for better performance
- [x] Add detailed error reporting for failed access removal operations
- [x] Enhance UI with real-time progress indicators and scope display
- [x] Fix access removal functionality with better error handling
- [x] Add helpful error explanations for common failure scenarios

---

## üîî Phase 11: Real-time Notifications (COMPLETED)
- [x] Design comprehensive notification system architecture
- [x] Implement browser notification integration with permission handling
- [x] Add Slack webhook integration with rich message formatting
- [x] Add Microsoft Teams webhook integration with MessageCard format
- [x] Create notification settings UI with test functionality
- [x] Build notification center for managing notification history
- [x] Develop notification bell component with real-time updates
- [x] Integrate notifications into existing features (DeleteUserAccess, ExportUsernames)
- [x] Add notification rules engine and filtering capabilities
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Create detailed documentation and setup guides
- [x] Resolve TypeScript compilation issues and achieve clean build
